Note that if you knit the .Rmd file, the appendix will not be there.

This is because we want the appendix to show up after the references, 
but Pandoc always places the References at the end of the .tex output.

So, the workaround is to create the appendix as a separate .tex file and
copy/paste it into the .tex file created when you knit from RMarkdown.
