### GET RELEVANT FIELDS FROM JSON OUTPUT FOR TURK EXPERIMENTS

```{r load libraries}
library(plotrix)
library(lattice)
library(rjson)
library(plyr)
library(chron)
library(car)
library(stringr)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
