Clear workspace and set working directory 

```{r clear workspace, echo=F, warning=F}

### Read in data from all 4 Experiments:

* Experiment 1: Large scale experiment manipulating attention and memory demands
* Experiment 2: Replication of Experiment 1 with more ecologically valid stimulus set
* Experiment 3: Parametric manipulation of cue reliablity
* Experiment 4: Manipulation of a fixed inspection time for exposure trials

```{r}
df_expt1 <- read.csv("2_raw_compiled/e1_soc_xsit_schematic.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
df_expt2 <- read.csv("2_raw_compiled/e2_soc_xsit_live_within.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
df_expt3 <- read.csv("2_raw_compiled/e3_soc_xsit_reliabiliy_parametric.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

```

## Experiment 1 

### Data cleaning 

```{r exp1 fix face index 6-referent condition}
# create a function to recode the face index variable in the 6-referent condition  to match the chosen index variable 
# we do this so we can know if participants selected the gaze target
convert_idx <- function(idx, numPic) {
  string_idx <- as.character(idx)
  new_idx <- ifelse(numPic != 6, idx, 
                    switch(string_idx,
                           "-1" = -1,
                           "0" = 2,
                           "1" = 3,
                           "2" = 4,
                           "3" = 5,
                           "4" = 0,
                           "5" = 1,
                           stop("Invalid entry to switch")))
  new_idx <- as.integer(new_idx)
}

# now we apply this function to each row of the data frame using rowwise()
df_expt1 %<>% 
  dplyr::rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(final_faceIdx = convert_idx(idx = faceIdx, numPic = numPicN)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```

### Flag correct/incorrect exposure and test trials

* Correct exposure trials are defined as selecting the gaze target if you were in the Gaze condition.
* Correct test trials are defined as selecting the object that was "kept" from the exposure trial.

```{r exp1 flag correct trials}
df_expt1 %<>%
  mutate(correct = ifelse(trial_category == "test" & chosen == kept, TRUE,
                          ifelse(trial_category == "exposure" & condition == "No-Social", NA,
                                 ifelse(chosenIdx == final_faceIdx, TRUE,
                                 FALSE))))
```

#### Remove fast and slow RTs on exposure trials 

```{r expt1 score gaze following on exposure}
df_expo_expt1 <- df_expt1 %>%
  filter(trial_category == "exposure") %>% 
  select(subid, itemNum, rt, condition, correct) %>% 
  rename(correct_exposure = correct, rt_exposure = rt) %>%
  filter(rt_exposure > 0) %>% 
  mutate(include_good_rt_exposure = ifelse(log(rt_exposure) > mean(log(rt_exposure)) + 
                                             2 * sd(log(rt_exposure)) |
                                             log(rt_exposure) < mean(log(rt_exposure)) - 
                                             2 * sd(log(rt_exposure)),
                                           "exclude", "include"))

# Merge exposure trial information with full dataset
df_expt1 %<>% left_join(y = df_expo_expt1, by = c("subid", "itemNum", "condition"))
```

#### Flag subs in the social condition who performed worse than chance on exposure trials.

```{r expt 1 flag subs < 25% correct on exposure trials}
df_test_expo_correct <- df_expt1 %>%
  filter(trial_category == "test") %>%
  group_by(subid, numPic, condition) %>%
  summarise(mean_acc_exp = mean(correct)) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(include_expo = ifelse(condition == "No-Social", "include",
                               ifelse(mean_acc_exp > 1/numPic, "include", 
                                      "exclude"))) %>% 
  ungroup()

df_expt1 %<>% left_join(., df_test_expo_correct, by = c("subid", "condition", "numPic"))
```

#### Flag test trials with really slow or fast RTs (+/- 2SD).

```{r expt1 rt cleaning}
df_test_rt <- df_expt1 %>% 
  filter(trial_category == "test") %>% 
  rename(rt_test = rt) %>% 
  filter(rt_test > 0) %>% 
  mutate(include_good_rt_test = ifelse(log(rt_test) > mean(log(rt_test)) + 
                                         2 * sd(log(rt_test)) |
                                         log(rt_test) < mean(log(rt_test)) - 
                                         2 * sd(log(rt_test)),
                                       "exclude", "include")) %>% 
  select(subid, itemNum, include_good_rt_test)

df_expt1 %<>% left_join(y = df_test_rt, by = c("subid", "itemNum"))
```

#### Save clean Expt. 1 dataset

```{r expt1 save clean dataset, eval = F}
write.csv(x = df_expt1, 
          "3_final-processed/soc-xsit-expt1-finalData.csv",
          row.names = F)
```

## Experiment 2

### Data cleaning

```{r exp2 fix face index 6-referent condition}
# create a function to recode the face index variable in the 4-referent condition  to match the chosen index variable 
# we do this so we can know if participants selected the gaze target

                    "-1" = -1,
                    "0" = 2,

                                  ifelse(condition == "SocialFirst" 
                                         & itemNum <= 7, "social", 
                                         ifelse(condition == "No-socialFirst" 
                                                & itemNum >= 8, "social",

                                                       "no-social", NA)))))

## Experiment 4: Inspection Time

### Data cleaning
